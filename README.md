**`Life Long Learner (Developer/Bug Killer/Cofee Addict/Tech-Savy)`**

Hi there! My name is Muhammadu Barry and I'm currently a computer science student at the City College of New York. I'm passionate about becoming a frontend developer and want to improve and advance in the tech industry. In my repos, you'll see that my work shows steady progress as I make an effort to improve my skills every day. My programming journey hasn't been easy, and I've faced procrastination and difficulties along the way. However, I've learned that every skill worth learning takes hard work and discipline. I hope to inspire others to improve their skills and showcase that with hard work and perseverance, anyone can achieve their goals.
